- Verify the dimensions of the rectangle are correct and appropriately labeled.
  Explanation: Ensure that the length is indeed 8 cm and the width is 5 cm to avoid errors in calculations.
- Calculate the area in square centimeters using the formula provided.
  Explanation: Since the formula for the area is already established, use it to calculate the area directly.
- Confirm the multiplication step yields a correct result.
  Explanation: Double-check the multiplication of the length and width to ensure the final area calculated is accurate.
- Present the calculated area as a final answer, including the units: 40 cm².
  Explanation: This step provides clarity by distinctly stating the result of the area calculation with the correct units.
- Multiply the length and the width: 8 cm × 5 cm = 
  Explanation: Calculate the numerical result by performing the multiplication.
- 40
  Explanation: Present the result of the multiplication 8 cm × 5 cm.
- Correction: 40.0 km/h
  Explanation: To find the area of the rectangle, we use the formula:

Area = Length × Width

Given:
- Length = 8 cm
- Width = 5 cm

Now, we can calculate the area:

Area = 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 cm²

The proposed solution is accurate. The calculation of the area yields the correct result. 

Thus, the final answer is:

**40 cm²**
Final Answer: The correct answer is 40.0 km/h
Numerical Answer: 40.0

Problem 3: If x + 3 = 10, what is the value of x?
Solution:
- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation.
  Explanation: To isolate x, we need to eliminate the constant term on its side.
- Identify the simplified equation: x = 7.
  Explanation: Once 3 is subtracted from both sides, the equation simplifies to x = 7.
- Check your initial equation: x + 3 = 10.
  Explanation: Verify that x + 3 equals 10 to ensure no errors occurred in the model.
- Confirm the solution by substituting: Substitute x = 7 back into the original equation: 7 + 3 should equal 10.
  Explanation: Verify the correctness of the solution by substituting x back into the original equation.
- Verify the final result of the addition: Does 7 + 3 equal 10?
  Explanation: This is the crucial step in confirming that the solution is correct.
- Write the verification statement: 7 + 3 = 10 and show the comparison.
  Explanation: Clearly articulate the verification process by comparing the two sides of the equation after substitution.
- Write the verification statement: 7 + 3 = 10.
  Explanation: Formally state the verification of the solution by writing down the addition result.
- Correction: 7.0 km/h
  Explanation: The original question asks for the value of \( x \) in the equation \( x + 3 = 10 \).

The proposed solution steps are accurate. Here's the breakdown:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   x + 3 = 10
   \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 3 - 3 = 10 - 3
   \]
   Which simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

3. To verify the solution, substitute \( x = 7 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   7 + 3 = 10
   \]
   This is true since \( 7 + 3 \) indeed equals \( 10 \).

The verification statement confirms the solution is correct. 

The extracted numerical answer mistakenly states 10.0, when the value of \( x \) is what needs to be reported. The correct numerical answer to the original question is: 

The value of \( x \) is \( 7 \). 

Thus, the correct numerical answer is \( 7 \).
Final Answer: The correct answer is 7.0 km/h

Problem 4: A store offers a 20% discount on a $50 item. What is the final price?
Solution:
- Subtract the discount amount from the original price.
  Explanation: After calculating the discount, subtract that amount from the original price to find the final price of the item.
- Calculate the discount amount by finding 20% of $50.

  Explanation: Presenting the final price succinctly in the requested format.
- Present the final value obtained as $40, indicating it clearly as the final price.
  Explanation: Clearly state the final price in an unambiguous manner to conclude the calculation.
- Correction: 40.0 km/h
  Explanation: The proposed solution is correct. Let's verify the calculations step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the discount**: The discount is 20% of the original price ($50).
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price**:
   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

Thus, the final price of the item after applying the discount is **$40**.

The answer is clearly stated as **$40**, and it directly addresses the original question without unnecessary additional calculations. Therefore, both the solution and the numerical answer provided are correct.
Final Answer: The correct answer is 40.0 km/h

- Write down the resulting equation after the addition: 3x = 21.
  Explanation: This represents the equation we reached once we added 7 to both sides, positioning x to be solved easily.
- Value of x is 7.
  Explanation: After calculating 21 ÷ 3, we obtain x = 7.
- State the relationship between x and 21 after addition: 3 times x equals 21.
  Explanation: This clarifies what we are solving for in terms of the number we already have.
- Express the relationship as x = 7 in an equation form: x = 21 / 3.

- Substitute the value of x back into the original equation to confirm the solution: 3(7) - 7 = 14.
  Explanation: This checks if the found value of x satisfies the original equation without invoking restricted steps.
- Correction: 7.0 km/h
  Explanation: Let's verify the solution to the equation \(3x - 7 = 14\).

1. **Original Equation**: 
   \[
   3x - 7 = 14
   \]

2. **Add 7 to both sides**:
   \[
   3x - 7 + 7 = 14 + 7
   \]
   \[
   3x = 21
   \]

3. **Divide both sides by 3**:
   \[
   x = \frac{21}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

4. **Substitution to Confirm**:
   Substitute \(x = 7\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(7) - 7 = 14
   \]
   \[
   21 - 7 = 14
   \]
   \[
   14 = 14 
   \]
   This is correct.

Thus, the value of \(x\) is correctly found to be \(7\).

### Final Answer
The numerical answer for \(x\) is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]

The proposed final answer included the calculation leading to \(14\) instead of the correct solution for \(x\) itself. The numerical answer confirming the solution of the original equation is indeed \(7\).
Final Answer: The correct answer is 7.0 km/h
Numerical Answer: 7.0
