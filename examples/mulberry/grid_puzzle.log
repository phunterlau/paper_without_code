Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it is the only even number available (1-4) that can be placed in position (1,1) while satisfying the requirement that the number in (1,1) must be even.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it is the only even number available (1-4) that can be placed in position (1,1), satisfying the condition that this position must hold an even number.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it is the only even number available (2) that can be placed in position (1,1) according to the specified rules. Since the numbers must be unique in each row and column, and the only even number from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} is 2, it fits the requirement perfectly. Additionally, it allows for valid placements in the remaining positions without violating the sum and greater-than constraints.

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it is even, satisfying the condition for (1,1). It also allows for the possibility of (2,2) being greater than (1,2) if (2,2) is 3 or 4, and it helps maintain the sum condition since the first row would then be 2 + 2 = 4, which is greater than the sum of the second row (0).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is not already in the grid and it is greater than 2, allowing for (2,2) to be 3, which satisfies the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2). It also helps ensure that the sum of the first row (2 + 4 = 6) is greater than the sum of the second row (0).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in the first row without violating the constraints. It maintains the uniqueness in the row and column, and since the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2), it allows for valid placements in (2,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it does not violate the uniqueness rule in the row and column. It also allows for the number in (2,2) to be greater than the number in (1,2), ensuring that the constraints are met.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it fits the requirement of being different from 2, satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number at (1,2) (since (2,2) can only then be 3), and helps to ensure that the sum of the first row exceeds that of the second row.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it meets the column constraints and allows for (2,2) to be 4, which is greater than 3, thus satisfying the condition. Additionally, it contributes to making the sum of the first row greater than the second.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (1,2) allows the first row to sum to 5 (2 + 3), while the second row can only sum to 4 (1 + 0), satisfying the condition that the sum of the first row is greater than the sum of the second row. Additionally, it does not violate the column constraint since the second column will then contain 3 and 0, which is valid.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (1,2) allows the first row to sum to 6 (2 + 4), while the second row can only sum to 3 (1 + 0), satisfying the condition that the sum of the first row is greater than the sum of the second row. Furthermore, it does not violate the column constraint since the second column will then contain 4 and 0, which is valid.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (1,2) allows for the first row to contain both an even number (2) and an odd number (3), satisfying the requirement for unique numbers in the row. Additionally, since (2,2) must be greater than (1,2) and can only be 4 (the only remaining number), this ensures that the second row can still meet the criteria of having unique numbers.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (1,2) would mean the second row can only contain 1, which would satisfy the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2). However, this does not satisfy the requirement that the sum of the first row is greater than the second row since the first row would then sum to 6 and the second row to 3.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it satisfies the condition of being even for position (1,1), and allows the sum of the first row to potentially exceed the second row as there are remaining options available for (2,1) and (2,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid as it is the only option left to keep the sum of the first row greater than the second row once the other placements are made. Also, it maintains uniqueness in the column.

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in (2,1) without violating the rules. The first row already contains 2, and the second row must contain 1 to satisfy the unique placement requirement.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,1) allows for 4 to be placed in (2,2), satisfying the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2) (which is 2). However, it does not satisfy the sum condition, so it is less likely.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining option for the first column, satisfying the requirement that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. Additionally, placing 1 in (2,1) allows for the number 2 to remain in (1,1), which is required to be even.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it does not violate any constraints and is not already present in the grid. Placing 3 in (2,1) allows for 4 to be placed in (2,2), which satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) is greater than the number in (1,2). However, it may not satisfy the sum condition.

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows the grid to maintain the unique number constraint in both rows and columns. It also satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3), since 1 < 3.

This number is valid because placing 4 in (2,1) allows the grid to maintain the unique number constraint in both rows and columns. It also satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3), since 4 > 3.

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is not already in the grid, and placing 1 in (2,1) satisfies the condition that each number appears exactly once in the rows and columns. It also allows the sum of the first row (2 + 3 = 5) to remain greater than the sum of the second row (1 + 0 = 1).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is not already in the grid, and placing 4 in (2,1) satisfies the condition that each number appears exactly once in the rows and columns. Additionally, it ensures that the number in (2,2) can be 3 (which is greater than 2), and the sum of the first row (2 + 3 = 5) is still greater than the sum of the second row (4 + 0 = 4).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only available number left for the first column while satisfying the sum condition for the rows. Placing 1 in (2,1) allows for (1,2) to be 3, which maintains the greater-than condition for (2,2). The sums would be (2+3=5) for the first row and (1+0=1) for the second row, which satisfies the requirement that the first row's sum is greater than the second's.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it does not violate the column constraints and placing 4 in (2,1) allows (1,2) to be 3 (already placed), leading to (2,2) being 2, which satisfies the condition for greater-than. However, it does not meet the sum condition (6 vs. 4). Thus, while it's a valid placement, it doesn't satisfy all requirements.

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it satisfies the requirement of being unique in the column and row. The first row already contains an even number (2), and placing 1 in (2,1) keeps the sum of the first row greater than the second row, as the first row will then sum to 6 (2 + 4) and the second row will sum to 1 (1 + 0).

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows for the even number 2 to remain in (1,1). With 2 already in (1,1) and 4 in (1,2), the grid can have the configuration [2, 4] in the first row, allowing 1 and 3 to occupy the second row, which results in a valid configuration. Additionally, the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 4) does not apply as there is no number in (2,2) yet.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because inserting 3 in (2,1) provides the potential to place 4 in (2,2), satisfying the condition that (2,2) must be greater than (1,2), which is 4. The grid can be completed as [2, 4] in the first row and [3, 4] in the second row, meeting all conditions of unique numbers in rows and columns.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is not already in the grid, and placing 1 in (2,1) allows the second row to have a sum less than the first row while satisfying the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it is already in the grid, and placing 2 in (2,1) maintains the even number in (1,1) and allows for a valid configuration where the sum of the first row can still be greater than the second row.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is not already in the grid, and placing 3 in (2,1) allows for a valid configuration where the sum of the first row can be greater than the second row, provided that (2,2) is 4.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:

✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows for 3 in (2,2), which satisfies the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2) since (1,2) is 3. It also keeps the first row sum greater than the second row sum, as the first row would sum to 5 (2+3) and the second row would sum to 4 (1+3).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,1) allows for 4 in (2,2), which satisfies the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2) since (1,2) is 3. However, this option does not meet the requirement for the first row sum to be greater than the second row sum, so it is less favorable.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only number left that can occupy the position (2,1) without violating the rules. The existing number in (1,1) is 2 (even), and the number in (1,2) is 3. Placing 1 in (2,1) would allow number 4 in (2,2), satisfying the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2). Additionally, the sum of the first row (2 + 3 = 5) is greater than the sum of the second row (1 + 4 = 5), thus satisfying the final condition as well.

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows the grid to satisfy all conditions. The first row will then contain 2 and 3, summing to 5, while the second row will contain 1 and 0, summing to 1. The number in (2,2) can be 4, which is greater than 3 in (1,2). This placement also ensures that each number from 1-4 is used exactly once.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (2,1) allows the grid to satisfy all conditions. The first row will then contain 2 and 3, summing to 5, while the second row will contain 4 and 0, summing to 4. The number in (2,2) can be 1, which is less than 3 in (1,2), but this does not satisfy the condition that (2,2) must be greater than (1,2). Therefore, this option is invalid.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in the first column without violating the rules. The number in (1,1) is 2 (even), and (2,2) must be greater than (1,2) which is 3, so (2,2) must be 4. Therefore, (2,1) must be 1 to satisfy all conditions.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is invalid because it cannot be placed in (2,1) since (2,2) must be greater than (1,2) which is 3. Placing 4 in (2,1) would not satisfy the requirement for (2,2) to be greater than (1,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it fits the requirement that each row and column should contain the numbers 1-4 exactly once. Also, placing 1 in (2,1) allows (2,2) to be 3 or 4 (which is greater than position (1,2) already containing 3) and maintains the sum requirements.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it would satisfy the requirement that number in (2,2) would then need to be 3 (which is greater than the number in (1,2) being 3). It helps ensure the sum of the first row remains greater than the second row.

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) will satisfy the condition that each number appears exactly once in the grid. It also allows for the placement of 4 in (2,2), which is greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3), thus satisfying the constraints.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (2,1) allows for 3 to be in (1,2) and 2 to remain in (1,1), satisfying the condition that the number in (2,2) (which would be 3) is less than the number in (2,1). However, this placement violates the uniqueness rule since 4 cannot be reused.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is not already in the grid, and it satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3). Placing 1 in (2,1) allows for 4 to be placed in (2,2), satisfying all conditions.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is not already in the grid, and it satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3). Placing 4 in (2,1) allows for 3 to be placed in (2,2), satisfying all conditions.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows the first row to contain 2 and 3, while the second row can contain 1 and 0. Additionally, 1 is less than 3, satisfying the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (2,1) allows the first row to contain 2 and 3, and the second row can then contain 4 and 0. This satisfies the requirement for the sum of the first row to be greater than the second row, and 4 is greater than 3, which satisfies the condition for (2,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it hasn't been used in the grid yet, and it allows the second row to remain lower in sum compared to the first row, which contains 2 and 3. Additionally, it does not violate any other conditions.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in (2,1) without violating the rules. The number 1 is not present in the grid, and placing it here allows the sum of the first row to be greater than the second row, as the first row will sum to 4 (2 + 2) and the second row will sum to 1 (1 + 0).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is not present in the grid and placing it in (2,1) allows the second row to sum to 3 (3 + 0), which is still less than the first row's sum of 4 (2 + 2). Additionally, it satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) if (2,2) is filled with 4.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) satisfies the constraints of having each number 1-4 appear exactly once in the grid. It also allows for the possibility of placing a valid number greater than it in (2,2), which needs to be greater than the number in (1,2) (currently 2). With 1 in (2,1), the only remaining number for (2,2) would be 3, which is greater than 2, satisfying all conditions.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,1) means that (2,2) must be 4 (the only remaining number). This keeps the grid valid, as 4 is greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 2). However, the sum of the first row (2 + 2) would still be greater than the second row (3 + 4 = 7), satisfying all conditions.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows us to use both even numbers in the grid (2 is already in the first row), satisfying the even placement rule in (1,1), and it does not violate the column constraints. Additionally, with 2 in (1,1) and 1 in (2,1), we can place 3 in (2,2) which is greater than the number in (1,2) (which must be 2). This combination allows for a greater sum in the first row than in the second since 2+3 > 1.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number can also work because 3 in (2,1) allows for placing 4 in (2,2), satisfying the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2) and allows the sum of the first row (2+4) to be greater than the second row (3). However, this placement would contradict the unique number requirement in the column since 2 is placed in (1,1).

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in (2,1) without violating the rules. The first row already contains 2 and 4, and the second row must contain 1 and 3. Placing 1 in (2,1) allows for 3 to be placed in (2,2), which satisfies the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2). Additionally, the sum of the first row (2 + 4 = 6) is greater than the sum of the second row (1 + 3 = 4).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,1) allows for 4 to be placed in (2,2), which satisfies the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2). However, this would violate the rule that each number must be used exactly once, as 4 is already in the first row. Therefore, this option is not valid.

✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:

This number is valid because it is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 3, satisfying the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2). Additionally, placing 4 in (2,2) allows the first row to sum to 5 (2 + 3) and the second row to sum to 5 (1 + 4), which does not satisfy the sum condition. However, since 4 is the only number left that can be placed in (2,2) while satisfying the other conditions, it is the only valid option.

This number is valid because it is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 3, satisfying the required condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater. It fits in the grid without violating the uniqueness condition as the other unique numbers 1 and 2 are already placed. The sum of the first row would be 2 + 3 = 5 and the second row would then be 1 + 3 = 4, fulfilling the constraint that the sum of the first row is greater than the second.

Additionally, placing 2 in (2,1) allows for the remaining number in (1,1) to be 4, satisfying the condition that (2,2) must be greater than (1,2) and ensuring that the sum of the first row is greater than the sum of the second row.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (2,1) allows for the remaining number in (1,1) to be 2, which satisfies the condition that (1,1) must be even. However, this placement would not satisfy the condition that (2,2) must be greater than (1,2), as it would force (2,2) to be 3, which is not greater than (1,2).

It does not violate any of the current constraints and contributes to keeping the first row's sum greater than the second row's sum.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number can be a valid option since it does not conflict with numbers already placed in the grid. It will keep the second row unique as well as ensuring that the total sum of the first row can still be higher than the second row's total.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,2) satisfies the condition that it is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4. Additionally, it fits the requirement that each number 1-4 appears exactly once in the grid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (2,2) satisfies the condition that it is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 0. However, it will not satisfy the requirement of having unique numbers in the grid since 4 is already in (1,2).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,2) satisfies all constraints: the grid would be [[2, 4], [1, 3]], which has different numbers in both the second row and column, and also meets the requirement of (2,2) being greater than (1,2). Additionally, the sum of the first row (2 + 4 = 6) is greater than the second row (1 + 3 = 4).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in (2,1) without violating the rules. The existing numbers in the grid are 2 and 3, and placing 1 here allows for the number in (2,2) to be 4, which is greater than 3. Additionally, the sum of the first row (2 + 3 = 5) will be greater than the sum of the second row (1 + 4 = 5), satisfying the condition.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in (2,1) allows for the number in (2,2) to be 3, which is less than 4. However, this violates the condition that the sum of the first row must be greater than the sum of the second row, as it would result in a tie (5 = 5). Therefore, this option is not valid.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows for the grid to maintain unique numbers in each row and column. It also satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3) if we place 4 in (2,2). The first row will then sum to 5 (2+3) and the second row will sum to 5 (1+4), which does not satisfy the sum condition. However, if we place 2 in (2,2) instead, the first row will sum to 5 and the second row will sum to 3, satisfying the sum condition.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it is even and fits in the grid without repeating any numbers in the same row or column. If we place 2 in (2,1), we can place 4 in (2,2) to satisfy the condition that the number in (2,2) is greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3). The first row will sum to 5 (2+3) and the second row will sum to 6 (2+4), satisfying the sum condition.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is not valid because 3 is already placed in (1,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because if we place 4 in (2,1), we can place 2 in (2,2) to satisfy the condition that the number in (2,2) is greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 3). The first row will sum to 5 (2+3) and the second row will sum to 6 (4+2), satisfying the sum condition.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows 2, 3, 4 to be placed in the remaining positions, satisfying all constraints. The number 1 is also less than the number in (1,2) (which is 3) and helps ensure that the sum of the first row is greater than the sum of the second row.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 2 because:
This number cannot be placed in (2,1) since 2 is already in (1,1).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is invalid because it conflicts with the existing number in (1,2), which is 3.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid, as it allows 2 and 3 in other positions while ensuring the sum constraints are still met. It also ensures that the number in (2,2) can remain greater than (1,2); specifically, 4 in (2,1) allows for positioning 2 in (2,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is considered valid because it meets the requirements of being greater than the number in (1,2) which is already placed as 4 in that column, and uniquely fulfills the grid condition maintaining unique entries for rows/columns. However, note there's a constraint violation because it is not greater than (1,2), thus actual use might be checked if other placements are possible.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Column 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4. It also satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Column 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is the only number left that can be placed in (2,2) without violating the rules. The existing numbers in the grid are 2 (even in (1,1)), 4 (in (1,2)), and 3 (in (2,1)). Placing 4 in (2,2) satisfies the requirement that it is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4, and it also ensures that the sum of the first row (2 + 4 = 6) is greater than the sum of the second row (3 + 4 = 7). However, since this does not satisfy the sum condition, we cannot choose this. Therefore, it is invalid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Column 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,2) satisfies the condition that it is greater than the number in (1,2) (which is 4), and it also satisfies the requirement of having unique numbers in the grid. However, it does not satisfy the condition of the sum of the first row being greater than the second row, making it invalid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining option that can be placed in (2,2) without violating the rules. However, placing 3 in (2,2) does not satisfy the condition that (2,2) must be greater than (1,2) which is 4, making it invalid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Row 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it satisfies the condition of being greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4, and also follows the rules of placing numbers 1-4 in the grid. The grid would then be [[2, 4], [3, 4]] which violates the unique number rule in the column, thus invalid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Column 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it does not conflict with existing numbers. Placing 1 in (2,2) would give [[2, 4], [3, 1]], and this conflicts with the requirement that (2,2) must be greater than (1,2), thus invalid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it fulfills the condition of being greater than the number in (1,2) if (1,2) was indeed a number, therefore checks out against our current grid. The resulting grid [[2, 4], [3, 3]] would then provide a conflict in repetition in a column, hence invalid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Row 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is not already present in the grid, and it satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) must be greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4. However, this would violate the uniqueness condition in the column, therefore it is not a valid option.

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in position (2,2) satisfies all rules: It is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4, ensuring the condition that (2,2) > (1,2) is met. Also, it maintains uniqueness in the column and row as 1 and 2 are already used. This also helps fulfill the requirement that the sum of the first row (2+4=6) is greater than the sum of the second row (1+3=4).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because placing 4 in position (2,2) maintains that (2,2) > (1,2), but violates the unique placement rule since it already exists in the grid. Therefore, it should not be suggested.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Column 2 contains duplicates

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because it is even and fits in the grid without violating the rules. The current grid has 2 in (1,1) and 1 in (1,2), leaving 3 and 4 for (2,2) and (2,1). Placing 2 in (2,1) allows for the possibility of placing 3 in (2,2), which satisfies the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2). Additionally, the sum of the first row (2 + 1 = 3) will be greater than the sum of the second row (2 + 3 = 5).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in (2,1) without violating the unique number rule in the columns. If 4 is placed in (2,1), then 3 can be placed in (2,2), satisfying the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2). However, this would make the sum of the second row (4 + 3 = 7) greater than the first row (2 + 1 = 3), which violates the sum condition. Therefore, this option is less favorable.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 4

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 2 because:
This number is valid because the current grid has 2 in (1,1) and 1 in (1,2), leaving only 3 and 4 available for (2,2). Since 2 is even, it satisfies the condition for (1,1). Moreover, placing 2 in (2,1) allows (2,2) to be either 3 or 4, which can satisfy the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2) (1). Additionally, the sum of the first row (2 + 1 = 3) will be greater than the sum of the second row (2 + 3 or 2 + 4 = 5 or 6) which satisfies the overall condition.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 2

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it does not violate any placement rules. It allows (2,2) to be 4, which is greater than (1,2) (1). The sums of the rows will still satisfy the condition that the first row sum is greater than the second row sum.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,1) maintains the requirement that each number appears exactly once in both rows and columns. Additionally, it satisfies the condition that (2,2) must be greater than (1,2), as 1 is already in (1,2) and it allows for the remaining placement of 4 in (2,2). The sum of the first row would then be 2 + 1 = 3, and the sum of the second row would be 3 + 4 = 7, thereby satisfying the condition that the sum of the first row is greater than the sum of the second row.

This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in the first column without violating the rules. The number 2 is already in (1,1), and 4 is in (1,2), leaving only 1 for (2,1).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in the first column without violating the rules. The first row already contains an even number (2), and placing 1 in (2,1) keeps the sum of the first row greater than the second row.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining odd number that can be placed in (2,1) without violating the rules. It ensures that the sum of the first row remains greater than the second row and does not conflict with existing placements.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only number left that can fit in position (2,1) while also satisfying the row and column constraints (each number must be unique in its row and column). The first row already has 2 and 4, and since (2,2) must be greater than (1,2), we can use 3 in (2,2), allowing the sum of row 1 (2 + 4) to be greater than the sum of row 2 (1 + 3).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid since placing 3 in (2,1) gives a possible configuration (2,4) in the first row and (3,1) in the second row, which allows (2,2) to potentially be 4 based on constraints. It would not work with positions due to column uniqueness, but still keeps potential options open.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is not already present in the grid, it is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4, and it satisfies the condition that the sum of the first row (2 + 4 = 6) is greater than the sum of the second row (1 + 3 = 4).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:

However, it does not satisfy the uniqueness condition in the column.

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is not already present in the grid, satisfies the condition of being greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4, and ensures that the sum of the first row (2 + 4 = 6) is greater than the sum of the second row (1 + 3 = 4).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is not already present in the grid and satisfies the condition of being greater than the number in (1,2) which is 4. However, it does not satisfy the sum condition since it would make both rows equal (6), thus it's less likely to be a valid solution.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is greater than the existing number in (1, 2) which is 4 (which we need to be careful of), and it fits in the second row without violating the unique placement rule for row and column. Also, placing 3 in (2, 2) maintains the ascending property required for (2, 2) > (1, 2). The sum of the first row will be 6 (2 + 4) and the second row will be 4 (1 + 3), fulfilling the condition of the first row sum being greater than the second row's.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
However, while technically greater than 0 in position (1, 2), placing 4 here cannot be valid due to already existing '4' and also violates the unique condition of grid, which states that each number 1-4 must appear exactly once in each row and column.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Column 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that satisfies the condition of being greater than the number in (1,2) which is 3. Additionally, placing 4 in (2,2) allows the first row to sum to 5 (2 + 3) and the second row to sum to 4 (4 + 0), satisfying the condition that the sum of the first row is greater than the sum of the second row.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Row 2 contains duplicates
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that is greater than the number in (1,2) which is 3. Additionally, placing 4 in (2,2) satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) is greater than the number in (1,2).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because 1 is not present in the grid and fulfills the requirement that it must be greater than the number in position (1,2), which is 3. Thus, it satisfies the condition that number at (2,2) is greater than the number at (1,2).
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is invalid because it violates the uniqueness condition as 3 is already present in the grid.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Column 2 contains duplicates
  - Number in (2,2) must be greater than (1,2)
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 4 because:
This number is valid because 4 is not present in the grid and is greater than 0 (the number at (1,2)). This satisfies the requirement that the number at (2,2) is greater than that at (1,2). However, it may affect the row sum requirement if combined with certain values in row 1.
❌ Invalid move! Violations:
  - Row 2 contains duplicates
  - Sum of first row must be greater than second row

Using CONSERVATIVE (temp=0.1)
Purpose: Conservative reasoning with high precision

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only remaining number that can be placed in (2,1) without violating the rules. The existing numbers in the grid are 2 and 4, and since 1 is not present, it satisfies the condition of each number appearing exactly once in each row and column.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.1, description='Conservative reasoning with high precision') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is also a remaining number that can be placed in (2,1). Placing 3 in (2,1) allows for the number in (2,2) to be 4, which is greater than the number in (1,2) (4). This satisfies the condition of the number in (2,2) being greater than the number in (1,2).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using BALANCED (temp=0.5)
Purpose: Balanced exploration and exploitation

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because it is the only number left that can be placed in the first column without violating the rules. The first column already has 2, and the second column has 4, making 1 the only valid choice for (2,1).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.5, description='Balanced exploration and exploitation') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because it is not present in the first column or the second column, and placing 3 in (2,1) allows the grid to satisfy the requirement that the sum of the first row (2 + 4) is greater than the sum of the second row (3 + 0).
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

Using CREATIVE (temp=1.0)
Purpose: Creative reasoning with more exploration

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 1 because:
This number is valid because placing 1 in (2,1) allows for the grid to have each number from 1 to 4 used exactly once. In the first row, we already have 2 and 4, and placing 1 in the second row helps ensure that the sum of the first row (2 + 4 = 6) is greater than that of the second row (1 + 0 = 1). Also, it satisfies the condition that the number in (2,2) should be greater than (1,2) as (1,2) is 0 and (2,2) can be either 3 or 4.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 1

Model ModelConfig(name='gpt-4o-mini', temperature=1.0, description='Creative reasoning with more exploration') suggests 3 because:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (2,1) allows for the completion of the grid with 2, 4 in the first row, and 3, possibly 0 in the second. When we place 3, (2,2) could be 4, which meets the condition that (2,2) is greater than (1,2), and the sum of the first row remains greater than that of the second row.
✅ Valid move! Adding node for number 3

[2, 3]
[0, 0]

Reasoning Path:

Step 1:
This number is valid because it is the only even number available (1-4) that can be placed in position (1,1) while satisfying the requirement that the number in (1,1) must be even.

Step 2:
This number is valid because placing 3 in (1,2) allows the first row to sum to 5 (2 + 3), while the second row can only sum to 1 (1 + 0), satisfying the condition that the sum of the first row is greater than the second row. Additionally, it does not violate the column constraint since 3 is not already in column 2.
