Reasoning: Increasing the number of estimators to 300 allows the model to train with more trees, which typically helps improve performance. Adjusting the learning rate to 0.1 and increasing `max_depth` to 6 can enhance the model's capacity to capture complex patterns without overfitting. Additionally, adjusting `min_child_weight` to 1 provides more robustness to prevent overfitting while allowing the model to learn better representations of the data.

This could involve analyzing the correlation of features with the target variable and selecting those that have a significant relationship.
No feature selection performed.

Executing action: feature_engineering
Reasoning: To enhance the feature set, we will apply advanced feature engineering techniques. This may include transforming existing features (e.g., log transformations, polynomial features) or creating new features based on domain knowledge. These techniques can help improve model performance by providing meaningful input to the model.

Reasoning: Increasing the number of estimators to 300 allows the model to train with more trees, which typically helps improve performance. Adjusting the learning rate to 0.1 and increasing `max_depth` to 6 can enhance the model's capacity to capture complex patterns without overfitting. Additionally, adjusting `min_child_weight` to 1 provides more robustness to prevent overfitting while allowing the model to learn better representations of the data.

Increasing max_depth to 14 and decreasing min_child_weight to 1 enables the model to learn more complex patterns while managing overfitting more effectively. Slight increments in subsample and colsample_bytree promote diversity in the training process, potentially leading to better performance.
Updated hyperparameters: {'n_estimators': 1200, 'learning_rate': 0.04, 'max_depth': 14, 'min_child_weight': 1, 'subsample': 0.85, 'colsample_bytree': 0.9}

Executing action: feature_engineering
Reasoning: Further advanced feature engineering can be applied, especially considering interactions and transformations of existing features. New features based on transformations of 'MedInc' or interaction terms between 'HouseAge' and 'AveOccup' may be investigated, as they ranked highly in importance. This could uncover additional predictive relationships that the model hasn't learned yet.
Performed feature engineering. New features: ['Interaction between features_HouseAge-AveOccup', 'Binning of continuous variables_MedInc', 'Domain-specific transformations_AveOccup-Population', 'Interaction between features_Latitude-Longitude', 'Mathematical transformation_AveRooms', 'Binning of continuous variables_Population', 'Mathematical transformation_HouseAge']

Executing action: feature_selection
Reasoning: Evaluating the remaining features for their importance is crucial. Since some features may not contribute significantly, this could reduce noise and improve model performance. Additionally, new synthetic features created during the previous engineering step could be assessed for their contribution too.
No feature selection performed.

Executing action: update_hyperparameters
Reasoning: Increasing n_estimators to 1500 may help in further convergence toward the optimal model. A slight decrease in learning_rate to 0.03 allows for finer adjustments in learning with more iterations. Increasing max_depth to 15 may help capture more complex relationships in the data.

Executing action: feature_engineering
Reasoning: Given the importance of transformed and binned features, we will apply advanced feature engineering techniques to create new features, like polynomial features and interaction terms beyond the ones already identified. This may enhance the model's capacity to learn complex relationships.
Performed feature engineering. New features: ['Mathematical transformation_Population', 'Interaction between features_MedInc-HouseAge', 'Interaction between features_Latitude-Longitude', 'Binning of continuous variables_AveOccup', 'Binning of continuous variables_MedInc', 'Aggregation of features_AveRooms-AveBedrms', 'Domain-specific transformations_Population-AveOccup-AveRooms', 'Domain-specific transformations_AveBedrms-AveRooms', 'Interaction between features_Population-AveOccup']

Executing action: feature_selection
Reasoning: To ensure that the model is focusing on not just the top features but also a diverse set of effective features, we will evaluate the importance of additional features and possibly remove those that contribute little to performance. This can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
